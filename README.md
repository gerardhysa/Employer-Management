# EmplyoeeManagement
In this project are integrated Php by using Laravel Framework, CSS, JavaScript, HTML by using Bootstrap and 
for database I have used MySQL. I have also used jQuery plugins such as jsTree and Datatables, also AJAX
is used to process the requests. This project provides registration, log in features, Datatable showing all the
registered users and a hierarchial tree which is formed from a database table of departments. Users are divided 
in normal users and admins where admins have more accessible features. Each user has a profile where can update its 
photo and information. This projects supports all of the CRUD operations in both users and departments tables.
